# Tennis Prediction
The project set out with a straightforward yet challenging aim: to build an algorithm that could predict tennis match results. This task was more than just about predictions; it was a chance for me to get hands-on with the pandas library in Python, learn how to clean and handle data effectively, and dip my toes into the practical uses of machine learning. Through a process of trial and error and continuous improvement, the project evolved from a simple concept to a tool that could make sense of detailed data and provide a glimpse into the outcomes of tennis matches.

## Project Skills
- Use of the pandas library for data manipulation.
- Techniques for cleaning and managing datasets.
- Application of machine learning for predictive modeling.
